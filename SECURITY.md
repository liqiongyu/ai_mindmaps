# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security issues via public GitHub issues.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:

- Go to the repository’s **Security** tab
- Click **Report a vulnerability**

If you cannot use Security Advisories, contact the maintainers privately.
