## Problem

Key pages still have mixed Chinese/English copy and inconsistent terminology, which increases cognitive load and makes the product feel less polished.

## Goals (P0)

Apply the copy dictionary in `docs/p0-p1-execution-plan.md` (Section 4.x) to the minimum set of core pages:

- `/login`, `/signup`
- `/mindmaps` list + empty states
- Editor toolbar + share/export labels + key hints (where applicable)
- Public page header buttons (`Home`, `Log in`, etc.)

## Acceptance criteria

- The above pages no longer have mixed-language UI; core terms are consistent (导图/节点/备注/分享/公开/私有).
- Dangerous actions and AI behavior hints match the dictionary wording.
