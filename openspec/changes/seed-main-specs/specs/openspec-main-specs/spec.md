## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Canonical specs live under `openspec/specs/`

The repository SHALL maintain canonical capability specs under `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` for ongoing iteration across changes.

#### Scenario: Baseline specs exist

- **WHEN** a capability has been introduced via an OpenSpec change
- **THEN** a corresponding main spec file SHALL exist under `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
